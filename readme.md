# Overleaf LaTeXML example
Pushing this project to it's GitHub repo will trigger a GitHub action that will compile the project to HTML using LaTeXML. 

Waiting a few minutes then pulling from the repo will bring the latest HTML back into the project, the old HTML will be removed.

The HTML output is provided as page<timestamp>.html, which can be downloaded (no preview at this time).

This is just an experiment, and the GitHub workflow files here should not be considered as examples of best practice for defining workflows. In time, we plan to develop more complete and generalizable examples of this and other approaches to using LaTeXML
